/**
 * <p>
 * Fuzzino is a library that provides generation of test data for fuzz testing.
 * With fuzzing, you are able to find security-related weaknesses in your code.
 * It's about injecting invalid or unexpected input data to a system under test.
 * That way, security-relevant vulnerabilities may be detected when the system
 * under test processes such data instead of rejecting it.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You can integrate Fuzzino into your testing tool in order to enable it for
 * fuzz testing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Please keep in mind that Fuzzino is not a full-featured fuzzing tool. It is a
 * test data generator for enabling your testing tool to perform fuzzing.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For further information and an introduction to the program take a look at
 * {@link de.fraunhofer.fokus.fuzzing.fuzzino.Fuzzino Fuzzino}.
